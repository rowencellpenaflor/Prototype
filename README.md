# Prototype

The following repository contains the codes used for creating the prototype application for the study entitled **Integrating Image Enhancement Technique with YOLOv10 for Vehicle Detection under Adverse Environmental Conditions**. The code contains an object detection model trained under Enhanced Dataset using the hyperparameters, AdamW Optimizer, Batch 32 and Epoch 100. The code also includes the implementation of enhancement techniques and the image enhancement metrics used during the study.
